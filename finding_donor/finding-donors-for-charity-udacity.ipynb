An example of this is that large input values (e.g. a spread of hundreds or thousands of units) can result in a model that learns large weight values. A model with large weight values is often unstable, meaning that it may suffer from poor performance during learning and sensitivity to input values resulting in higher generalization error.\n\nMin-max scaling is a common feature pre-processing technique which results in scaled data values that fall in the range [0,1]. When applied to a Python sequence, such as a Pandas Series, scaling results in a new sequence such that 0 is the minimum value and 1 is the maximum value of the prior unscaled sequence. If the sequence is [1, 2, 3], then the scaled sequence is [0, 0.5, 1].\n\n\nhttps://machinelearningmastery.com/standardscaler-and-minmaxscaler-transforms-in-python/ </br>\nhttps://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-scale-pandas-dataframe-columns-with-the-scikit-learn-minmaxscaler-in-python\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Log-transform the skewed features\n#we now that this two columns are highly skewed. \nskewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']\nfeatures_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)\nfeatures_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-17T17:31:41.609570Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-17T17:31:41.610336Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-17T17:31:41.619733Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-17T17:31:41.610295Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-17T17:31:41.618953Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":74,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features\nscaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)\nnumerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']\n\nfeatures_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)\nfeatures_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])\n\n# Show an example of a record with scaling applied\ndisplay(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-17T17:31:53.719222Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-17T17:31:53.719677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-17T17:31:53.749236Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-17T17:31:53.719628Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-17T17:31:53.748386Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3 Data preprocessing\nOur machine learning algorithm can not work with categorical features, we need always numerical data. we got two possibilities to arrange that.

But this means we would have some rank in our machine learning algorithm. Because the number one would rank higher than the number one. this can cause a problem. </br>\nThe second option is that we give all our categorical data a figure between 0 and 1. In the easiest case, we got only two options. For example, we got married and unmarried. Married would get 0 and unmarried would get 0. but if we take divorced also in our data we got already for married 0,0,1 and for unmarried 0,1,0 and for divorced 1,0,0.
